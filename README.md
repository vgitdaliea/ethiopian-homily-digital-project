# Ethiopian Homily Digital Project

This collaborative digital humanities project aims to create an annotated translation of a public-domain Ethiopian homily on the Virgin Mary from the Gädlä Māryām. The project serves as a resource for the upcoming Princeton scholar event and as a lasting digital artifact for the community.

## Goals

- Provide a scholarly translation of a significant passage from the homily
- Offer rich historical and cultural context through annotations
- Analyze artistic elements (illuminations) in relation to the text
- Foster collaborative engagement among scholars and students

## Chosen Text

The selected passage is the opening 20 lines of a homily on the Virgin Mary, a text widely venerated in Ethiopian Orthodox Täwaḥədo Church tradition. The homily, written in Ge'ez (Classical Ethiopic), exemplifies the rich literary and theological heritage of medieval Ethiopia.

## Structure

- `sources/`: Contains the original Ge'ez text
- `translations/`: Contains translation drafts and annotations
- `art/`: Houses manuscript images and illuminations
